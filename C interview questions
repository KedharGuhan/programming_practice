How to define static members in C
static members are stored in the static data area
default initial value of static classes variables is 0 otherwise null.
static variable can be initailized only once.
In c it is not necessary to initialize the static variable where as in C++ it is needed
declaring a function as static in C, acessess to the function are restricted to the file.

Client Server program
What is a socket
Sockets are end point of a communication
Client:
-creates a socket using socket function call.
-Socket(namespace (AF_NET | PF_LOCAL),Communication style, protocol)
-Configure the server addr - bzero(servaddr) , set the family and port of servaddr, set the ip address of server using inet_pton
-use connect(sockfd, servaddr, sizeof(servaddr)
Server:
-create a socket, only need to specify namepace, communication and protocol
-configure server address structure, use bzero for servaddress, set the family and port.
-bind the socket to the server port
-call listen to turn it into a listening socket
-accept(listenfd, struct sockaddr*) - start accepting connections. returns a socket for the new connection to take place
-use select function call to have non-blocking io
What is the memory requirements of a pointer
Size of the pointer will be the size required to address a memory location.
In 64 bit address, it is 2^64 addresable memory.
To store a 64 bit address, we need 8 bytes.
size of the pointer will be 8 bytes
I byte = 8 bits
IKB = 1024bytes
1MB = 1024 KB
1GB = 1024 MB = 2^30
4 GB = 4 *1024MB = 2^32
8 GB = 8* 1024MB
