1. static storage in data block 
2. static variables always init to 0 when not explicitly inited
3. remains in memory when the program is running
4. can be inited only using constants

C++ references:
once reference is created, cannot be changed to refer to something else
references cannot be NULL

int x = 5;
int &y = x;

Virtual fucntions: type of the objext rather than the type of the pointer

declaration vs definition
declaration = tells a type or functions exists ; ret type, args
defintion = allocate storage

storage specifiers in C = auto , extern, static, register

dangling pointer:  points to a invalid memory location

static functions : C functions are global by default
declaring it static makes restricts the access to the file

i++ vs ++i
precedence of postfix > prefix
